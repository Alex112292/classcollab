  b Welcome to my page my name is Henok Ketsela
  p <strong>About me:</strong>
    &nbsp; I was originally born in Ethiopia,Africa and came to America when I was eight years old. America was more
    technologically advanced compared to my home country, Ethiopia 🇪🇹, this sparked my interests in computers and
    anything related to tech.
  p <strong>Reason for majoring in Computer Science:</strong>
    &nbsp; As i mentioned earlier I have always been interested in computers growing up. As a got older my interest in
    computers and how they worked grew with me. I started coding in high school and enjoyed it. So when it came time to
    go to college it was an obvious choice for me to major in Computer Science. Im currently a junior attending
    Quinnipiac University.
